# Loan Calculator App
This Loan Calculator App is a modern, single page web application built using React Js and Material UI. It allows users to calculate loan EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments), view a detailed amortization schedule, and see real-time currency conversions of their EMI using live exchange rates.

* Formula: EMI = [P * R * (1+ R)^N] / [(1+ R)^N - 1]
 * P = Principal (loan amount)
 * R = Monthly interest rate (annualRate / 12 / 100)
 * N = Loan duration in months
